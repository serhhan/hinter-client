# Report for Serhan - Regarding: Peer Connection Suggestions

## Information / Opportunity / Insight
I'd like to suggest some valuable connections within my hinter-core network that might be beneficial for you to connect with directly:

**Emanuel Tesar** - Available for hinter-core peer connections.

**Bedirhan Uzun** - Available for hinter-core peer connections.

**Jiri Herzan** - Available for hinter-core peer connections.

**Prenaam Dolou** - Available for hinter-core peer connections.

**Ali Konuk** - Available for hinter-core peer connections.

**Hayrettin Iletmis** - Available for hinter-core peer connections.

**Mertcan Karik** - Available for hinter-core peer connections.

## Context / Background (If necessary for this item)
These are all trusted peers in my hinter-core network who have successfully set up their systems and are actively participating. Each brings unique expertise that could complement your work, and since you all work at Api3, you're already familiar with each other. All Api3 personnel are in the same Slack workspace and these people post their public keys on the #hinter-core channel.

## Suggested Action / Next Steps (If applicable to this item)
You can reach out to them directly through other channels.

I'd also recommend adopting this peer connection practice with your own network as a hinter protocol best practice - it helps strengthen the overall network effect.
