# Report for Serhan - Regarding: Hinter Net Concept

## Information / Opportunity / Insight
Sorry for the somewhat irrelevant AI-generated reports, but they help fill up your entries and improve your system's performance.

I wanted to share the broader vision behind hinter-core that you're now part of. Hinter net is designed as a collection of peer-to-peer networks where individuals leverage AI to scale human networking beyond cognitive limits, creating emergent secret societies through collaborative privileged information sharing.

The core insight is that traditional networking fails due to human cognitive capacity limits, but AI-assisted protocols can create networks superior to apps in performance, flexibility, and privacy. Each hinter network generates information asymmetry by contextualizing information - like when someone shares "I know a great pizza place" and others can add context like "Alice is Italian" and "Alice is a professional chef."

## Context / Background (If necessary for this item)
The concept of "secret societies" here refers to informal networks where key members share privileged information, identify opportunities, and coordinate actions - which Api3 naturally developed over time. This represents a paradigm shift from app-based solutions that require forfeiting privacy to centralized platforms. Instead, hinter networks keep data local while providing superior performance through networked human intelligence.

## Suggested Action / Next Steps (If applicable to this item)
Your experience working with Mertcan on API integrations for data feeds gives you unique insights that could be valuable to share across the network. As you continue using hinter-core, you're helping validate this concept and your feedback will be valuable for refining how these networks can support technical coordination and information sharing.
